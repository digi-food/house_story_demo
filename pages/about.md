## About Vernacularium

Dwellings are examples of sites where shared practices are manifested in material ways, and where humans leave behind evidence of their temporal and spatial presence.Some cultural traditions can only be practised in specific spaces. Inscriptions under wallpaper, objects concealed in walls, carved initials, or handprints in concrete all constitute vernacular artefacts â€“ evidence of how dwellings become repositories which document the presence of its inhabitants over time. 
Vernacularium is an archive of these objects, photographed and tagged by subject to facilitate further research. The project emphasises dwellings as places of cultural production and exists on the premise that the products of recognisable human behaviour within dwellings are important primary sources for humanities research. The possibility that an investigation into dwelling artefacts could bring to light unseen, unheard stories of the people who created them is an exciting prospect, and the goal is that the archive will become more useful as more objects are added over time. 
This site was built using
  [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a tool to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

This first iteration of Vernacularium features objects from the private collection of the project's Principal Investigator, K. Colette Hill.   [You can see more of her work here. ](https://www.anevolvingworkinprogress.com).
